# Quick Examples Fix Summary

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Issue:** Quick examples were returning incorrect crop predictions

---

## 🔍 Problem Identified

The quick examples in the Streamlit app had two major issues:

### 1. **Wheat Doesn't Exist in Dataset**
- The "Wheat Conditions" button was trying to predict wheat
- **Wheat is NOT one of the 22 crops in the dataset**
- Available crops: apple, banana, blackgram, chickpea, coconut, coffee, cotton, grapes, jute, kidneybeans, lentil, maize, mango, mothbeans, mungbean, muskmelon, orange, papaya, pigeonpeas, pomegranate, rice, watermelon

### 2. **Incorrect Parameter Values**
- The parameter values for quick examples were not optimal
- Examples were predicting wrong crops:
  - **Rice example** → Predicted RICE (48.2%) ✅ but with jute (45.9%) very close
  - **Wheat example** → Predicted MAIZE (53.2%) ❌ (wheat doesn't exist)
  - **Cotton example** → Predicted BANANA (34.3%) ❌ (cotton was only 2nd at 29.2%)
  - **Maize example** → Predicted MAIZE (51.0%) ✅ but low confidence

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Replaced Wheat with Chickpea**
- Chickpea has similar characteristics to wheat (low rainfall, moderate temperature)
- Chickpea exists in the dataset and is a common Rabi crop

### 2. **Updated Parameter Values**
Used median values from the actual dataset for each crop:

#### **Rice Conditions** (Updated)
- **Old:** N=80, P=40, K=40, Temp=25°C, Humidity=80%, pH=6.5, Rainfall=200mm
- **New:** N=80, P=47, K=40, Temp=23.7°C, Humidity=82.2%, pH=6.4, Rainfall=233mm
- **Result:** Predicts RICE with **87.9% confidence** ✅

#### **Chickpea Conditions** (Replaces Wheat)
- **New:** N=39, P=68, K=79, Temp=18.9°C, Humidity=16.7%, pH=7.4, Rainfall=80mm
- **Result:** Predicts CHICKPEA with **97.9% confidence** ✅

#### **Cotton Conditions** (Updated)
- **Old:** N=120, P=60, K=50, Temp=28°C, Humidity=70%, pH=7.0, Rainfall=100mm
- **New:** N=117, P=46, K=19, Temp=24.0°C, Humidity=80.0%, pH=6.8, Rainfall=80mm
- **Result:** Predicts COTTON with **89.8% confidence** ✅

#### **Maize Conditions** (Updated)
- **Old:** N=70, P=50, K=45, Temp=24°C, Humidity=65%, pH=6.5, Rainfall=90mm
- **New:** N=76, P=48, K=20, Temp=22.8°C, Humidity=65.3%, pH=6.3, Rainfall=84mm
- **Result:** Predicts MAIZE with **86.1% confidence** ✅

## 📊 Verification Results

All quick examples now correctly predict their intended crops as #1:

```
RICE Example:
  Predicted: RICE (87.9%)
  Top 3: rice (87.9%), jute (11.3%), coconut (0.3%)
  ✅ RICE is #1 in top 3

CHICKPEA Example:
  Predicted: CHICKPEA (97.9%)
  Top 3: chickpea (97.9%), kidneybeans (1.7%), mothbeans (0.2%)
  ✅ CHICKPEA is #1 in top 3

COTTON Example:
  Predicted: COTTON (89.8%)
  Top 3: cotton (89.8%), maize (6.4%), watermelon (1.8%)
  ✅ COTTON is #1 in top 3

MAIZE Example:
  Predicted: MAIZE (86.1%)
  Top 3: maize (86.1%), cotton (3.7%), watermelon (2.6%)
  ✅ MAIZE is #1 in top 3
```

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. **app.py**
- Updated quick example button labels (Wheat → Chickpea)
- Updated parameter values for all 4 examples
- Added chickpea to crop_info dictionary

### 2. **docs/non-related/APP_FEATURES_GUIDE.md**
- Updated quick examples section with new parameters
- Added prediction confidence percentages

### 3. **docs/non-related/QUICK_START_STREAMLIT.md**
- Updated Example 2 from Wheat to Chickpea
- Updated parameter values for Rice and Cotton examples
- Updated expected confidence percentages

## 🎯 Impact

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Wheat example didn't work (crop doesn't exist)
- ❌ Cotton example predicted wrong crop (banana instead of cotton)
- ⚠️ Rice and Maize examples worked but with low confidence

### After Fix:
- ✅ All 4 examples predict correct crops
- ✅ High confidence (86-98%)
- ✅ All crops exist in the dataset
- ✅ Parameters based on actual dataset median values
