# ML Model Training Bug - Fixes Applied

**Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ PART 1 COMPLETE | üîÑ PART 2 IN PROGRESS

---

## ‚úÖ PART 1: Quick Examples Feature Removed

### Changes Made to `app.py`:

1. **Removed quick examples buttons** from sidebar (lines 232-243)
2. **Removed examples dictionary** and related logic (lines 255-267)
3. **Simplified default slider values** to use static mid-range values:
   - N, P, K: 50
   - Temperature: 25.0¬∞C
   - Humidity: 70.0%
   - pH: 6.5
   - Rainfall: 100.0mm
4. **Removed session state cleanup logic** (lines 337-339)

**Result:** The Streamlit app now has a cleaner interface without the problematic quick examples feature.

## üîÑ PART 2: Model Training Bug Fixes

### Root Cause Identified:

**Critical Bug:** Models were trained with **DataFrames** (which store feature names) but during prediction receive **numpy arrays** (without feature names), causing feature order mismatch and incorrect predictions.

**Evidence:**
```
UserWarning: X does not have valid feature names, but [Model] was fitted with feature names
```

### Diagnostic Results (Before Fixes):

- ‚ùå **11 models STUCK** predicting the same crop for all inputs
- ‚úÖ **1 model working** (Logistic Regression)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **5 models with errors** (PCA, DBSCAN, Linear Regression)

### Notebooks Fixed:

#### 1. ‚úÖ `04_SVM_Classification.ipynb` - FIXED

**Changes Applied:**
- Added scaling step after loading data:
  ```python
  X_train_scaled = scaler.transform(X_train)
  X_val_scaled = scaler.transform(X_val)
  X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)
  ```
- Updated all model.fit() calls to use scaled data:
  - Line 120: `svm_linear.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`
  - Line 169: `svm_rbf.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`
  - Line 218: `svm_poly.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`
  - Line 280: `grid_search.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`
- Updated all predictions to use scaled data

**Models Affected:**
- SVM Linear
- SVM RBF
- SVM Polynomial
- SVM Best (from grid search)

#### 2. ‚úÖ `07_Ensemble_Methods.ipynb` - FIXED

**Changes Applied:**
- Added scaler loading: `scaler = joblib.load('../data/processed/scaler.pkl')`
- Added scaling step after loading data
- Updated all model.fit() calls to use scaled data:
  - Line 145: `rf_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`
  - Line 215: `gb_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`
  - Line 284: `ada_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`
  - Line 355: `xgb_model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)`
- Updated all predictions to use scaled data

**Models Affected:**
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- AdaBoost
- XGBoost

## üìã Notebooks Still Need Fixing:

### High Priority:

#### 3. ‚è≥ `06_LDA_Analysis.ipynb` - TODO
**Issue:** Models stuck predicting kidneybeans  
**Fix Needed:**
- Add scaler loading
- Add scaling step
- Update model.fit() to use scaled data
- Update predictions to use scaled data

**Models Affected:**
- LDA Best Model
- LDA Full Model

#### 4. ‚è≥ `08_CART_Decision_Trees.ipynb` - TODO
**Issue:** Models stuck predicting kidneybeans  
**Note:** Decision Trees don't require scaling, but need to avoid feature name mismatch  
**Fix Needed:**
- Option A: Use `.values` to convert DataFrame to numpy array:
  ```python
  model.fit(X_train.values, y_train)
  ```
- Option B: Use scaled data for consistency (recommended):
  ```python
  model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)
  ```

**Models Affected:**
- Decision Tree models

### Medium Priority (Error Models):

#### 5. ‚è≥ `02_Linear_Regression.ipynb` - TODO
**Error:** "X has 7 features, but LinearRegression is expecting 6 features"  
**Fix Needed:**
- Check if model was trained on wrong feature set
- Retrain with correct 7 features
- Add scaling step

#### 6. ‚è≥ `05_PCA_Analysis.ipynb` - TODO
**Error:** "X has 7 features, but LogisticRegression is expecting 5 features"  
**Issue:** PCA reduces dimensions, so prediction pipeline needs to apply PCA first  
**Fix Needed:**
- Save PCA transformer along with model
- Create prediction pipeline: scaler ‚Üí PCA ‚Üí model
- Update app.py to handle PCA models differently

## üéØ Next Steps:

### Step 1: Fix Remaining Notebooks

1. Fix `06_LDA_Analysis.ipynb` (same pattern as SVM and Ensemble)
2. Fix `08_CART_Decision_Trees.ipynb` (use .values or scaled data)
3. Fix `02_Linear_Regression.ipynb` (check feature count)
4. Fix `05_PCA_Analysis.ipynb` (save PCA transformer)

### Step 2: Delete Broken Model Files

Before retraining, delete all broken model files:

```bash
# Navigate to models directory
cd models/saved_models

# Delete broken models (keep logistic_regression.pkl)
rm adaboost_model.pkl
rm best_random_forest_model.pkl
rm gradient_boosting_model.pkl
rm lda_best_model.pkl
rm lda_full_model.pkl
rm random_forest_model.pkl
rm svm_best_model.pkl
rm svm_linear_model.pkl
rm svm_poly_model.pkl
rm svm_rbf_model.pkl
rm xgboost_model.pkl
```

### Step 3: Retrain All Models

Run the fixed notebooks in order:
1. `04_SVM_Classification.ipynb` ‚úÖ (ready to retrain)
2. `06_LDA_Analysis.ipynb` ‚è≥ (fix first)
3. `07_Ensemble_Methods.ipynb` ‚úÖ (ready to retrain)
4. `08_CART_Decision_Trees.ipynb` ‚è≥ (fix first)

### Step 4: Verify Fixes

Run the diagnostic script after retraining:
```bash
python diagnose_model_bug.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ All models predict different crops for different inputs
- ‚úÖ No "feature names" warnings
- ‚úÖ No models stuck on single crop
- ‚úÖ Reasonable accuracy (>80%) on test data

### Step 5: Test in Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

Test each model with different parameter combinations to ensure varied predictions.

## üîë Key Takeaways:

1. **Always use scaled data** for models that require it (SVM, Neural Networks, etc.)
2. **Always fit models with numpy arrays**, not DataFrames, to avoid feature name issues
3. **Pattern to follow**: `model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train)` where `X_train_scaled` is a numpy array
4. **Consistency is key**: Use the same data type (numpy array) for both training and prediction
5. **Test thoroughly**: Use diverse test cases to ensure models aren't stuck

**Status:** Ready for you to review the fixes and decide whether to:
1. Continue fixing the remaining notebooks (I can do this)
2. Retrain the models yourself after reviewing the fixes
3. Test the fixed notebooks first before proceeding

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
